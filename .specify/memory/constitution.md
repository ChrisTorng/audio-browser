# Audio Browser Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All 程式碼 MUST adhere to strict quality standards: comprehensive type safety, clear function and variable naming that reflects audio domain concepts, consistent formatting via automated tools, and zero tolerance for code smells. Every 函式 MUST have a single responsibility, maximum complexity of 10 cyclomatic units, and comprehensive documentation including parameter types and expected behavior. Refactoring is mandatory when complexity thresholds are exceeded.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is strictly enforced: Tests MUST be written before implementation, user scenarios MUST be validated through acceptance tests before any 程式碼 is written, and the Red-Green-Refactor cycle is non-negotiable. All audio processing functionality MUST include unit tests with sample audio files, integration tests for audio format compatibility, and performance benchmarks. Test coverage MUST be >= 90% for critical audio processing paths.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interactions MUST follow consistent patterns: standardized audio player controls across all components, uniform loading states and error handling for audio operations, predictable keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features, and responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. Audio playback MUST provide consistent visual feedback (waveforms, progress indicators) and maintain state across navigation. User preferences MUST persist between sessions.

### IV. Performance Requirements
Audio operations MUST meet strict performance criteria: audio files MUST load within 2 seconds for files <50MB, playback latency MUST be <100ms, memory usage for audio buffers MUST not exceed 200MB per active track, and browser responsiveness MUST be maintained during processing. All audio processing MUST support Web Workers for non-blocking operation. File indexing operations MUST complete within 5 seconds for directories containing <1000 files.

### V. Audio Format Standards
The system MUST support standard audio formats (MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG, AAC) with consistent metadata extraction, waveform generation, and playback quality. All audio operations MUST preserve original file integrity, support both streaming and full-file loading based on file size, and provide graceful degradation for unsupported formats. Audio quality MUST never be compromised during processing operations.

## Performance Standards

Audio processing performance MUST meet real-time requirements: waveform visualization rendering at 60fps, seamless audio streaming without gaps or dropouts, efficient memory management with automatic cleanup of unused audio buffers, and optimized file I/O operations. All heavy operations MUST be performed in Web Workers to maintain UI responsiveness. Performance monitoring and automatic optimization for different device capabilities is mandatory.

## Development Workflow

Code review MUST verify adherence to all constitutional principles before merge. All pull requests MUST include: passing test suite with audio-specific test cases, performance benchmarks meeting established thresholds, documentation updates for new audio features, and verification of cross-browser audio compatibility. Complexity violations MUST be justified with technical necessity and approved by maintainers. Regular audits of audio processing efficiency and user experience consistency are required.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. Any amendments require: documented technical justification, approval from project maintainers, migration plan for existing 程式碼, and validation that changes maintain audio processing quality standards. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with constitutional principles. Complexity increases MUST be justified with clear technical necessity. Violations require immediate remediation or architectural refactoring. Regular constitutional compliance audits are mandatory for all audio processing components.
